Disease Models Using SBML Arrays
================================

This repository implements several simple disease models using and extension to the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) called [SBML Arrays](http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications/SBML_Level_3/Packages/arrays)

The purpose of this work is to show that it is possible to generate reproducible disease models using the SBML array package.

The models are implemented using two systems: 
1. iBioSim using SBML files generated by a python script 
2. The MIcroSimlation Tool (MIST) as a reference for comparison

These examples are supporting the paper titled: "Disease Models using the System Biology Markup Language (SBML)".

This work extends previous work on [sharing disease models](https://github.com/Jacob-Barhak/SharingDiseaseModels) to support micro-simulation.

USAGE:
------
Each file uses a different system and format. To run some of the files to reproduce paper results specific tools are required:
The following tools and versions were used to generate the results in this paper:
* MIST Version 0.92.0.0 - Install from: https://github.com/Jacob-Barhak/MIST executed on a Windows 7 (64 bit) machine using Python 2.7.11 | Anaconda 2.4.1 (64-bit)
* SBMLExamplesForPaper.py required libsbml experimental version 5.15.0 that can be obtained from https://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/5.15.0/ for this work it was executed on a Windows 7 (64 bit) machine using Python 2.7.11 | Anaconda 2.4.1 (64-bit) 
* iBioSim - Ihttp://www.async.ece.utah.edu/ibiosim

### For MIST files
1. Install MIST
2. Run: python MISTGUI.py
3. Load the *.zip file using File->Load from the menu

### To Regenerate iBioSim results
0. Optional: You can regenerate the SBML files already provided in this repository using the command: python SBMLExamplesForPaper.py
1. Install IbioSim using the instructions in: http://www.async.ece.utah.edu/ibiosim
2. Run iBioSim
3. Select from the menu: File->New->Project and write a new directory name where the project wil be hosted and press ok
4. Select from the menu: File->Import and select the Exampl?.xml file to load, ignore SBML errors appearing and press ok.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
-----------------
Many thanks to the SBML discussion groups that helped with this work by participating in the discussion or providing solutions:  Lucian Smith, Brett Olivier, Nicolas Le Novere, Fengkai Zhang, Sarah Keating.

This work used the MIcro Simulation Tool (MIST) that is based on IEST. The IEST GPL disease modeling framework was initially supported by the Biostatistics and Economic Modeling Core of the MDRTC (P60DK020572) and by the Methods and Measurement Core of the MCDTR (P30DK092926), both funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The modeling framework was initially defined as GPL and was funded by Chronic Disease Modeling for Clinical Research Innovations grant (R21DK075077) from the same institute. MIST, however, was developed without financial support.
